        customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation
        policy. Under this policy:
      </p>

      <h2>1. Order Cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within{" "}
        <strong>the same day</strong> of placing the order. However, the
        cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have already
        been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the
        process of shipping them.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Perishable Items</h2>
      <p>
        ECOMMERCE SHOPPING PRIVATE LTD does not accept cancellation requests for{" "}
        <strong>perishable items</strong> like flowers, eatables, etc. However,
        refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
        quality of product delivered is not good.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Damaged or Defective Items</h2>
      <p>
        In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the same
        to our Customer Service team. The request will be entertained once the
        merchant has checked and determined the same at their end. This should
        be reported within <strong>the same day</strong> of receipt of the
        products.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Product Mismatch or Not as Expected</h2>

        per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our Customer
        Service within <strong>the same day</strong> of receiving the product.
        The Customer Service Team will review your complaint and take an
        appropriate decision.
